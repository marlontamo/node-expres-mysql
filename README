# Setting Up the Project

## Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` File:
   - Open your text editor and create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.

2. Add Environment Variables:
   - Inside the `.env` file, add the following lines with your MySQL database connection details:
     ```
     MYSQL_HOST='***.*.*.*'
     MYSQL_USER='****'
     MYSQL_PASSWORD='*******'
     MYSQL_DATABASE='*****'
     ```
   - Replace the placeholders (`***.*.*.*`, `****`, `*******`, `*****`) with your actual MySQL database host, username, password, and database name respectively.

## Creating the Database in phpMyAdmin

1. Access phpMyAdmin:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to phpMyAdmin by entering the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).

2. Log in:
   - Log in to phpMyAdmin using your credentials.

3. Create a New Database:
   - Once logged in, locate the option to create a new database. This is usually found in the sidebar or as a button labeled "New" or "Create new database."
   - Enter a name for your database (e.g., `notes_db`) in the provided field.

4. Define Table Structure:
   - After creating the database, navigate to it by selecting it from the list of databases.
   - Look for an option to create a new table. This is usually labeled "New" or "Create new table."
   - Define the table structure with the following columns:
     - `id`: An integer primary key with auto-increment.
     - `title`: A text field to store the title of the note.
     - `contents`: A text field to store the contents of the note.

5. Save Changes:
   - After defining the table structure and specifying the column details, save the changes. This usually involves clicking a button labeled "Save" or "Create" at the bottom of the page.
